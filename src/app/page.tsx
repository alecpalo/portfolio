                          I am a recent graduate from the University of Michigan with degrees in Computer Science and
                          Business
                          Administration looking for work as a software developer. I have experience with Full Stack
                          Development
                          and embedded systems through my previous work experience. I am interested in working with
                          embedded
                          systems,
                          backend and infrastructure work.

                          I fell into computer science randomly through a business analytics class that used R as a
                          sophomore in college.
                          I had never programmed before and really enjoyed it, deciding to take a computer science class
                          the
                          following semester.
                          I fell in love with novel problem solving computer science gave me and learning about how everything
                          in the world works. This led me to decide to stay a 5th year at Umich to complete a computer science
                          degree and pivot to becoming a software developer.

                          I always love learning new things and meeting new people, feel free to reach out to me!
